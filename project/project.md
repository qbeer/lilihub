### Brainstorming:
* what else should it do?
* other functionality?
   * do we stick to a initial profil picture that is a simple figure or upload is allowed?
   * allow short videos to be uploaded ?
   * we could also add 'places to visit'
   * blind chat: drop two individuals into a conversation, if they turn out to like each other they can reveal their profile pictures
   * do wo want a mobile app as well then? - i guess if we are doing great with the webpage we could as them to teach us to make a mobile app too
   * send gifts to other users
* do initial matching or let people to do it by themselves? 
   * both! by searching and with an algorithm that lists a few people who could be  matched, or match them automatically. there could be a discover menu for that - gr8 idea :)
* homepage:
   * if user chooses register: 
		* creating profile through a set of questions following each other. some can be marked important or not ?
