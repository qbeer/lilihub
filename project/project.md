## Logged-in user:
* view registered users' profiles
* search registered users' profiles
* update status
* chat
* a heart or a symbol on the profile page (?)

## Visitor:
* view number of registered users
* register
* chat anonymously (?)
   * it's up to you guys, would it be useful for a dating site? or maybe it could be a 
   blind dating feature?

### Brainstorming:
* what else should it do?
* other functionality?
   * do we stick to a initial profil picture that is a simple figure or upload is allowed?
* do initial matching or let people to do it by themselves? 
   * both? by searching and with an algorithm that lists a few people who could be  matched, or match them automatically? there could be a discover menu for that or     something
